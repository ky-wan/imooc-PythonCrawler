# imooc-PythonCrawler

* This project is based on the online learning course 《Simple Pyhton Crawler Development》on imooc:
https://www.imooc.com/learn/563

* The code is slightly different from the orignal code shown in the course due to the changes of 
Python version and website adress. It works well so far on Jan 16th. 2018.

* The following modules are used based on Pyhton 3.6:
urllib、bs4、http.cookiejar、urllib.parse、string、re

* The Test catalog contains the materia taught in section 5&6. <br/>The baike_spider catalog contains the example taught in section 7.
